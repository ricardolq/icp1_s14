# ICP1 S14: Linked List Implementations

This repository contains examples of linked list implementations in C, demonstrating various operations and use cases.

## Subdirectories

### `src/lists`
- Implements a **singly linked list** to manage `Person` structures.
- Features include insertion, deletion, searching, printing, and clearing the list.
- Example executable: `SimpleLinkedList`.

### `src/orderedlist`
- Implements an **ordered linked list** where nodes are stored in a sorted manner based on the name.
- Supports operations like ordered insertion, deletion, searching, and printing.
- Example executable: `SimpleOrderedLinkedList`.

## Build and Run Instructions

Each subdirectory contains its own `README.md` file with detailed build and run instructions. Use CMake to configure and build the projects.

## Purpose

These examples serve as educational resources for understanding linked list data structures and their operations in C.
